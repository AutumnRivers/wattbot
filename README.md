# Wattbot  
## What is Wattbot?  
Wattbot is an original Discord bot made by `SmartiePlays#5434`. It interacts with the Wattpad API and is able to return details about stories and reading lists. It can even check to see if Wattpad is up!  
## Is this bot associated with Wattpad?  
No, but that would be really cool if it was.  
## Wattpad? Aren't there mature stories on that?  
Yep, but Wattbot has a filter for that. If you're in a non-NSFW channel, Wattbot will not show any results marked as mature.  
**PLEASE NOTE!**  
This filter may not always work. If a story is not marked as mature, then it passes through the filter. If a mature story does appear even in an NSFW-disabled channel, it's not my fault. And it's not Wattpad's fault. You are already given a link to the stories you search for. Go to that link and report the story.  
## What are your planned features?  
I'm glad you asked! I plan to:  
* Use SQL to allow users to use Wattbot to make reading lists, add stories to their reading lists, etc. So long as they log in with Wattpad to an upcoming site.  
* Support offset for searches  
* Allow for searching more than just stories and reading lists
